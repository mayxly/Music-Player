This is a program that allows users to add songs to a playlist and play the songs in the playlist.\
Songs from an album can also be added into a playlist, which utilizes Java OOP principles with "album" as one class and "song" as another.

Here is the option menu for the music player:

0 - Quit\
1 - Play next song\
2 - Play previous song\
3 - Show all songs\
4 - Show all options\
5 - Delete current song\
6 - Add new song
